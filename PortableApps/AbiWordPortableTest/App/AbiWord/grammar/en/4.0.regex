% This file contains regular expressions that are used to match
% tokens not found in the dictionary. Each regex is given a name which
% determines the disjuncts assigned when the regex matches; this name
% must be defined in the dictionary along with the appropriate disjuncts.
% Note that the order of the regular expressions matters: matches will
% be attempted in the order in which the regexs appear in this file,
% and only the first match will be used.

% Numbers.
% XXX, we need to add utf8 U+00A0 "no-break space"
% The ":" is included here so we allow "10:30" to be a number
%
% This one matches the original LG rule.
% NUMBERS: /^[0-9][0-9:.,]+$/
% This allows more, e.g. "-5" and "5-10" and "9+/-6.5"
NUMBERS: /^[0-9:.,-]*[0-9]([0-9:.,-]|\+\/-[0-9:.,-])*$/
% "10(3)" exponent (used in PubMed)
NUMBERS: /^[0-9:.,-]*[0-9][0-9:.,-]*\([0-9:.,-]*[0-9][0-9:.,-]*\)$/

% Roman numerals
% The first expr has the potential(?) problem that it matches an empty
% string, this should be fixed.

% Some "safe" derived units. Simple units are in dictionary.
% The idea here is for the regex to match something that is almost
% certainly part of a derived unit, and allow the rest to be
% anything; this way we can capture difficult derived units such
% as "mg/kg/day" and even oddities such as "micrograms/mouse/day"
% without listing them explicitly.
% TODO: add more. 
% Some (real) misses from these: 
% micrograms.kg-1.h-1 microM-1 J/cm2 %/day mN/m cm/yr
% m/s days/week ml/s degrees/sec cm/sec cm/s mm/s N/mm (is that a unit?)
% cuts/minute clicks/s beats/minute x/week W/kg/W %/patient-year
% microIU/ml degrees/s counts/mm2 cells/mm3 tumors/mouse
% mm/sec ml/hr mJ/cm(2) m2/g amol/mm2 animals/group
% h-1 min-1 day-1 cm-1 mg-1 kg-1 mg.m-2.min-1 ms.cm-1 g-1
% sec-1 ms-1 ml.min.-1kg-1 ml.hr-1
% also, both kilometer and kilometers seem to be absent(!)
% remember "mm"!

% combinations of numbers and units, e.g. "50-kDa", "1-2h"
% TODO: Clean up and check that these are up-to-date wrt the 
% dictionary-recognized units; this is quite a mess currently.
% TODO: Extend the "number" part of the regex to allow anything
% that the NUMBER regex matches.
% One problem here is a failure to split up the expression ... 
% e.g. "2hr" becomes 2 - ND - hr with the ND link. But 2-hr is treated
% as a single word ('I is a 2-hr wait')

% fold-words. Matches NUMBER-fold, where NUMBER can be either numeric
% or a spelled-out number, and the hyphen is optional. Note that for
% spelled-out numbers, anything is allowed between the "initial" number
% and "fold" to catch e.g. "two-to-three fold" ("fourteen" etc. are absent
% as the prefix "four" is sufficient to match).
