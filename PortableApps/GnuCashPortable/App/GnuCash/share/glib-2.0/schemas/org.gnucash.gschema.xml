      <summary>Allow file incompatibility with older versions.</summary>
      <description>If active, gnucash will be allowed to intentionally break file compatibility with older versions, so that a data file saved in this version cannot be read by an older version again. Otherwise gnucash will write data files only in formats that can be read by older versions as well.</description>
