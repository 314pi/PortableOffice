GETTING HELP: If you need help with GnuCash, please do not contact any of the
Documentors directly. Instead, first look at http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/FAQ to
see if your question is common and is answered there. If that doesn't help,
there are mailing lists in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and
Portuguese and an English IRC channel. More information can be found at
http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Mailing_Lists and http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/IRC.
