<h2>Color Palettes in Scribus (7): NAA Colors</h2>

<p><a href="www.naa.org">The Newspaper Association  of America (NAA)</a> is the trade association for newspapers in the United States and Canada. As a nonprofit organization representing nearly 2,000 newspapers and their multiplatform businesses, the association focuses on major issues that affect today&rsquo;s newspaper industry. </p>

<h3>The NAA Colors Palette</h3>
<p>If you are making color ads to be printed in a newspaper (or otherwise on newsprint) in North America you will likely want to use the NAA Colors palette. Using the 51 NAA CMYK colors within Scribus allows advertisers to create ads that have colors which are optimized to match the colors they will get when an ad is being printed in a typical newspaper printing workflow.</p>

<h3>The NAA Color Ink Book</h3>
<p>Color palettes are most useful when a printed color reference is available. In the case of NAA Colors this reference is called &ldquo;Color Ink Book,&rdquo; the current version of which is Vol. 10 (2006). It&rsquo;s available for purchase through the <a href="http://netforum.naa.org/eWeb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=NAA&WebKey=433e9741-6cfa-4ce4-b172-3f1c905a9deb">NAA website</a>.</p>
