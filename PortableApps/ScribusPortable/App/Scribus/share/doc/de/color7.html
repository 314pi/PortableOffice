<h2>Color Palettes in Scribus (5): GiveLife Color System&reg;</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.givelifecolorsystem.com">GiveLife Color System&reg;</a> is a Spanish company founded by designers and engineers to create new color systems for graphics and design professionals, especially in the Hispanic world.</p>

<p>Until now, GiveLife Color System&reg; has developed two numerical color systems, one in RGB and one in CMYK. Scribus is the first graphics program which is being shipped by default with the GiveLife Color System&reg; color palettes.</p>

<h3>The palette &ldquo;GiveLife Color System CMYK&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This palette consists of 2265 CMYK colors, each of which has a five-digit numerical code. The system has been developed for use in print-related projects. The company offers a printed color reference for this palette on its <a href="http://www.givelifecolorsystem.com">website</a>. This <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/givelifecolorsystem/">&ldquo;Color Guide Book&rdquo;</a> has been created using the ICC profile FOGRA 39 (ISO 12647-2:2004).</p>

<h3>The palette &ldquo;GiveLife Color System RGB&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The second palette comprises 5101 RGB colors, each of which has a four-digit numerical code. The correct ICC profile for use with this palette is sRGB.</p>

<p>Note that you need to <a href="cms.html">install</a> the profiles listed above to use the colors reliably.</p>
