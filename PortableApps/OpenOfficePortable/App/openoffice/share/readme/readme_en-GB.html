<h3>Is OpenOffice really free for any user? </h3>
<p>OpenOffice is free for use by everybody. You may take this copy of OpenOffice and install it on as many computers as you like, and use it for any purpose you like (including commercial, government, public administration and educational use). For further details see the licence text delivered together with OpenOffice or <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/license.html">http://www.openoffice.org/license.html</a></p>
<h3>Why is OpenOffice free for any user?</h3>
<p>You can use this copy of OpenOffice today free of charge because individual contributors and corporate sponsors have designed, developed, tested, translated, documented, supported, marketed, and helped in many other ways to make OpenOffice what it is today - the world's leading open-source office software.</p>
<p>If you appreciate their efforts, and would like to ensure Apache OpenOffice continues into the future, please consider contributing to the project - see <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/get-involved.html">http://openoffice.apache.org/get-involved.html</a> for details on contributing time and <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html">http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html</a> for details on donations.

<div id="Installation">
<h2>Notes on Installation</h2>
<p class="note">OpenOffice requires a recent version of JAVA for full functionality; JAVA can be downloaded from <a href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a>.</p>
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<div id="SystemRequirements_WIN">
<ul>
<li><p>Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8</p></li>
<li><p>Pentium III or later processor</p></li>
<li><p>256 MB RAM (512 MB RAM recommended)</p></li>
<li><p>Up to 1.5 GB available hard diskcspace</p></li>
<li><p>1024x768 resolution (higher resolution recommended), at least 256 colours</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="note">Please be aware that administrator rights are needed for the installation process.</p>
<p>Registration of OpenOffice as default application for Microsoft Office formats can be forced or suppressed by using the following command line switches with the installer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>/msoreg=1</tt> will force registration of OpenOffice as default application for Microsoft Office formats.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>/msoreg=0</tt> will suppress registration of OpenOffice as default application for Microsoft Office formats.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you perform an administrative installation using setup /a, you need to make sure that the file msvcr100.dll is installed on the system. This file is required for OpenOffice to start after an administrative installation. You can get the file from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555</a></p>
<p class="note">Please be aware that administrator rights are needed for the installation process.</p>
</div>
<p>Please make sure you have enough free memory in the temporary directory on your system and that read, write and run access rights have been granted. Close all other programs before starting the installation.</p>
</div>
<div id="StartupProblems">
<h2>Problems During Program Start-up</h2>
<p>Difficulties starting OpenOffice (e.g. applications hang) as well as problems with the screen display are often caused by the graphics card driver. If these problems occur, please update your graphics card driver or try using the graphics driver delivered with your operating system. Difficulties displaying 3D objects can often be solved by deactivating the option "Use OpenGL" under 'Tools - Options - OpenOffice - View - 3D view'.</p>
</div>
<div id="Scroll">
<h2>ALPS/Synaptics notebook touchpads in Windows</h2>
<p>Due to a Windows driver issue, you cannot scroll through OpenOffice documents when you slide your finger across an ALPS/Synaptics touchpad.</p>
<p>To enable touchpad scrolling, add the following lines to the "<tt>C:\Program Files\Synaptics\SynTP\SynTPEnh.ini</tt>" configuration file, and restart your computer:</p>
<p class="code">[OpenOffice]</p>
<p class="code">FC = "SALFRAME"</p>
<p class="code">SF = 0x10000000</p>
<p class="code">SF |= 0x00004000</p>
<p class="note">The location of the configuration file might vary on different versions of Windows.</p>
</div>
<div id="Keyboard">
<h2>Shortcut Keys</h2>
<p>Only shortcut keys (key combinations) not used by the operating system can be used in OpenOffice. If a key combination in OpenOffice does not work as described in the OpenOffice Help, check if that shortcut is already used by the operating system. To rectify such conflicts, you can change the keys assigned by your operating system. Alternatively, you can change almost any key assignment in OpenOffice. For more information on this topic, refer to the OpenOffice Help or the Help documention of your operating system.</p>
</div>
<div id="Mapi">
<h2>Problems When Sending Documents as E-mails From OpenOffice</h2>
<p>When sending a document via 'File - Send - Document as E-mail' or 'Document as PDF Attachment' problems might occur (program crashes or hangs). This is due to the Windows system file "Mapi" (Messaging Application Programming Interface) which causes problems in some file versions. Unfortunately, the problem cannot be narrowed down to a certain version number. For more information visit <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a> to search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for "mapi dll".</p>

<h3>How to Start</h3>
<p>The best way to start contributing is to subscribe to one or more of the mailing lists, lurk for a while, and gradually use the mail archives to familiarize yourself with many of the topics covered since the OpenOffice source code was released back in October 2000. When you're comfortable, all you need to do is send an email self-introduction and jump right in.</p>
<h3>Subscribe</h3>
<p>Here are a few of the OpenOffice mailing lists to which you can subscribe at <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html">http://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html</a></p>

<h3>Joining the Project</h3>
<p>You can make major contributions to this important open source project even if you have limited software design or coding experience. Yes, you!</p>
<p>At <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/get-involved.html">http://openoffice.apache.org/get-involved.html</a> you will find a first overview where you can start with, ranging from Localization, QA, user support to some real core coding projects. If you are not a developer, you can help with Documentation or Marketing, for example. The OpenOffice marketing is applying both guerrilla and traditional commercial techniques to marketing open source software, and we are doing it across language and cultural barriers, so you can help just by spreading the word and telling a friend about this office suite.</p>
