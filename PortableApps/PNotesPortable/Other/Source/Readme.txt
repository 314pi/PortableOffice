About PNotes Portable
=====================
The PNotes Portable Launcher launches PNotes with its settings in Portable Apps Format Complaint Directory format.


LICENSE
=======
This code is released under the GPL.  The full code is included with this package as
PNotesPortable.nsi.


INSTALLATION / DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
==================================
The program expects this directory structure:

-\ <--- Directory with PNotesPortable.exe
	+\App\
		+\PNotes\
	+\Data\
		+\settings\
	+PNotesPortable.ini (Optional)

PNotesPortable.INI CONFIGURATION
==================================
The PNotes Portable Launcher will look for an ini file called PNotesPortable.ini (read the previous section for details on placement).  If you are happy with the default options, it is not necessary, though.  The INI file is formatted as follows:

[PNotesPortable]
AdditionalParameters=
DisableSplashScreen=false

The AdditionalParameters entry allows you to pass additional commandline parameter
entries to PNotes.exe.  Whatever you enter here will be appended to the call to
PNotes.exe.

DisableSplashScreen allows you to disable the splash screen when set to true.

Support for renaming the App directories, Settings directory, and the PNotes executable was dropped in the PNotes Portable 5.5 (Launcher version 1.8.0.0) Release.
